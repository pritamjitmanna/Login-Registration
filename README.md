# Login-Registration
Login registration is one of the main and first things that one need to create for most of its sites.
In my WebD journey, I tried to make many things using the features and this one is also one of them.
I just wanted to implement those features that are much needed in a login portal, with not much of a design in the home page.
Hope you like it!

I have used Node Js to implement the Backend with MongoDB as its database. The UI is not much completed, just wanted to see things.
